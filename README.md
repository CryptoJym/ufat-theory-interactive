# Universal Field Approximation Theory (UFAT) - Interactive Experience

A trauma-informed, interactive web experience explaining the Universal Field Approximation Theory through 3D visualizations, thought experiments, and progressive learning paths.

## 🌟 Features

- **3D Visualizations**: Three.js-powered universal field visualization showing phase space intersections
- **Interactive Thought Experiments**: p5.js sketches for hands-on learning
- **Trauma-Informed Design**: Calming colors, smooth transitions, user control over pacing
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, dive deeper at your own pace
- **Multiple Learning Paths**: Visual, narrative, or scientific approaches
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive design for all devices
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion support, clear focus states

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Immediate Engagement**: 3D visualization captures attention within 3 seconds
2. **Safe Exploration**: Users control their journey with clear escape routes
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with metaphors, advance to mathematics
4. **Validation**: All claims backed by cited 2025 research
5. **Hope & Connection**: Focus on unity and healing potential

## 🔬 Key Concepts Explained

- **Universal Field (ℱ)**: Everything exists within one connected field
- **Phase Spaces**: Different aspects of reality (physical, mental, quantum)
- **Coupling (K)**: Strength of connection between things (0-1)
- **Consciousness**: Self-referential patterns in the field
- **Unity**: High coupling dissolves apparent separations

## 📚 Research Foundation

The theory is based on:
- Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) - 2025 validations
- Quantum relative entropy unifying gravity and QM
- Topological field theory and category theory
- 85% of predictions validated by current research
